Opted for Option 2 that is Fragmented UI into componenets.
Fragmenting the UI into selective components enhances readability and maintainability of the codebase. It follows the principles of component-based architecture, promoting reusability and modularity. Breaking down the UI into smaller, more manageable parts allows developers to focus on specific functionalities or sections of the application independently. This approach also facilitates easier collaboration among team members and improves code comprehension, making it easier to debug and maintain over time.

Also, the existing code is written in TypeScript I tried my very best to get familiar with some syntax, however as you mentioned not to spend more than 2 hours, so here's everything I could do in 2 hours. Thankyou providing this opportunity to me :)
